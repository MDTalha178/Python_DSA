# Problem Statement
"""
Sum of Two Arrays
Two random integer arrays/lists have been given as ARR1 and ARR2 of size N and M respectively. Both the arrays/lists contain numbers from 0 to 9
(i.e. single digit integer is present at every index). The idea here is to represent each array/list as an 
integer in itself of digits N and M.
Sample Input 1:
1
3
6 2 4
3
7 5 6
Sample Output 1:
1 3 8 0
